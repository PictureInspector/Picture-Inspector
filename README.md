To run this server you need to install [Python3+](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).
And [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### Server installation

Clone server repository from https://github.com/PictureInspector/Picture-Inspector-server

Follow the instructions: https://github.com/PictureInspector/Picture-Inspector-server/blob/develop/README.md

### Telegram bot installation
 
Clone telegram bot repository from https://github.com/PictureInspector/picture-inspector-bot

Follow the instructions: https://github.com/PictureInspector/picture-inspector-bot/blob/develop/README.md
## Repositories
The project consists of several repositories that contain the code for different modules:
1. Picture-Inspector-server
https://github.com/PictureInspector/Picture-Inspector-server
2. picture-inspector-bot
https://github.com/PictureInspector/picture-inspector-bot
   
We did it this way because the server with the neural network and the bot are logically independent parts of the system.
